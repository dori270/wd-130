            <h3>Site Purpose</h3>
            <p>I have a daughter who only likes books about boys.

                No, she's not a boy-crazy ten year old. It's just that she's noticed something: books with male protagonists tend to be more exciting and adventurous. Basically, they're more fun to read. And all kids--girls and boys--want to enjoy what they read.
                
                My website will serve as an interactive list of novels with female protagonists AND adventurous plots. So unlike the drama and friendship-strife that characterize so many of the stories targeting young girls, the female-led books featured on my website will deliver good, old-fashioned fun and entertainment.
                
                And who knows? Maybe more girls will be inspired to write their own stories about adventurous females. Maybe one day I'll be asking my granddaughter why she loves to read books about girls.</p>
